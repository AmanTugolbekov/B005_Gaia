Project Report: Gaia (B005) – Experimental PET Bottle to 3D Printer Filament Recycler

1. Executive Summary
Project Gaia (B005) successfully demonstrates a functional, small-scale workflow for converting post-consumer PET bottles into usable 3D printer filament. The system comprises two core modules: a Mechanical Bottle Processor that cuts bottles into uniform strips, and a Thermal Extrusion & Sizing Line that converts these strips into 1.75mm filament. While the output is not industrial-grade, it is fully capable of producing prototypes and functional test parts, validating the concept of local, micro-recycling. This report details the technical design, experimental parameters, key challenges encountered, and quantifiable results, providing a blueprint for replication and further development.

2. Project Overview

· Title: Gaia – Small-Scale PET Recycling and Filament Extrusion Line
· Code: B005_Gaia
· Core Concept: To transform PET plastic waste (bottles) into a valuable resource (3D printer filament) through an accessible, modular, and documented process. The focus is on practical workflow understanding over idealized output.
· Project Status: Proof-of-Concept / Experimental. Functional workflow established, with ongoing optimization for consistency.

3. Objectives

· Primary: Design, build, and test an integrated mechanical system for processing PET bottles into filament.
· Technical:
  1. Achieve consistent PET strip width (±0.3mm) from the cutting mechanism.
  2. Establish a stable extrusion temperature profile for recycled PET.
  3. Produce filament with a target diameter of 1.75mm ± 0.1mm, suitable for use in standard FDM printers.
  4. Document all parameters, failures, and adjustments in an open-source repository.
· Philosophical: To explore the technical and practical barriers to decentralized recycling, making the process transparent and accessible.

4. System Design & Technical Specifications
The Gaia system is a linear process consisting of two main stages.

Stage Module Key Components Function & Specifications
1. Preparation Bottle Pre-Processor Manual station for label/cap removal, bottle washing, and drying. Ensures clean, contaminant-free feedstock.
2. Shredding Mechanical Strip Cutter - Feed rollers (spring-loaded) - Rotary blade assembly (4 blades, stainless steel) - Width guide rail (adjustable: 3-8mm) - DC motor (12V, 60 RPM) - Collection spool holder Cuts bottle into a continuous, uniform strip. Target Strip: 5mm width, 0.2-0.3mm thickness (bottle wall).
3. Extrusion Filament Extruder - Hopper (modified for strip feed) - Heated barrel (single zone, 220W cartridge) - Auger screw (compression ratio 3:1) - Nozzle (brass, 1.75mm orifice) - PID temperature controller (K-type thermocouple) Melts and homogenizes PET strips. Operating Temp: 245-260°C.
4. Sizing & Spooling Calibration & Wind-up - Water cooling bath (ambient temp, 30cm length) - Laser-based diameter sensor (0.01mm resolution) - Dual-axis puller mechanism (stepper motors) - Spool winder with tensioner Cools, measures, and spools the filament. Target Speed: 0.8-1.2 meters/minute.

5. Experimental Parameters & Material Science
Feedstock: Clear/transparent PET bottles (Type 1). Colored bottles introduce impurities and variable melt behavior.
Key Process Parameters Tested:

Parameter Tested Range Optimal Value Found Observation
Extrusion Temperature 230°C - 270°C 255°C ± 5°C Below 240°C: high viscosity, clogging. Above 265°C: thermal degradation (yellowing, bubbling).
Strip Feed Rate 0.5 - 2 m/min 1 m/min Synchronized with puller speed to prevent under/over-feeding the extruder.
Puller Speed 0.7 - 1.5 m/min 1.05 m/min Critical for diameter control. A 5% speed increase over feed rate provided optimal tension.
Cooling Method Air (fan) vs. Water Bath Water Bath Air cooling caused uneven crystallization and warping. Water bath provided rapid, uniform cooling, reducing internal stresses.

Material Behavior Notes:

· Moisture: PET is hygroscopic. Undried strips caused severe bubbling (foaming) in the extruder, leading to porous and weak filament.
· Solution Implemented: A simple pre-drying stage (4+ hours at 65°C in a food dehydrator) was added before extrusion, which eliminated the issue.
· Crystallinity: Rapid cooling from the melt produces amorphous, clear filament. Slow cooling or annealing can increase crystallinity, making it more opaque and brittle.

6. Results & Performance Analysis

· Output Consistency: The system reliably produces continuous filament. Diameter consistency is the main challenge.
  · Best Achieved Tolerance: 1.75mm ± 0.07mm over a 50m spool.
  · Typical Tolerance: 1.75mm ± 0.15mm.
· Filament Usability:
  · Printability: Successful prints have been achieved with simple geometries (calibration cubes, hooks, brackets). Retraction settings need adjustment due to slightly variable viscosity.
  · Mechanical Properties: Subjective testing shows the printed parts are rigid and have functional strength for low-stress applications, comparable to entry-level virgin PETG in stiffness but with lower layer adhesion.
· Yield: Approximately 12-15 standard 0.5L PET bottles yield 1 kg of raw strip material, resulting in ~0.9 kg of spooled filament (10% loss in trimming and startup).

7. Challenges & Failure Analysis
This project is built on iterative learning from failures, documented thoroughly in the repository.

Challenge Root Cause Solution Implemented
Filament breaking during spooling High internal stress from uneven cooling; moisture content. Implemented longer, regulated water bath; added mandatory pre-drying stage.
Diameter variability ("sharkskin") Unstable melt pressure due to inconsistent strip feed width. Redesigned cutter guide rails for better strip uniformity; added a filament diameter sensor for visual feedback.
Nozzle clogging Contamination (glue from labels, dirt); thermal degradation char. Enforced stricter bottle cleaning protocol; installed a fine metal mesh filter in the extruder barrel.
Poor layer adhesion in prints Low melt temperature during printing; inconsistent filament diameter. Increased hotend temperature by 10-15°C compared to virgin filament; focused on improving diameter stability.

8. Conclusion & Future Directions
Project Gaia has conclusively proven that creating a functional, small-scale PET-to-filament recycling line is not only possible but also an invaluable educational and prototyping tool. The most significant insight is that consistency is the true challenge, not the basic process.

Key Conclusion: The project successfully transitioned from a theoretical demonstration to a practical manufacturing workflow, producing "prototype-grade" filament that enables a tangible circular economy loop on a desktop scale.

Proposed Future Development:

1. Automated Diameter Control: Implement a closed-loop system where the laser sensor data actively adjusts the puller motor speed in real-time.
2. Multi-Material Testing: Experiment with blends (e.g., adding a small percentage of recycled PLA to modify flexibility).
3. Quantitative Material Testing: Build a test rig to measure tensile strength, layer adhesion, and tolerance statistics for each production batch.
4. Module Standardization: Design the bottle cutter and extruder feed as standalone, open-source modules for others to easily replicate or improve.

9. Safety Considerations

· Thermal: High-temperature surfaces (extruder barrel, nozzle) pose burn risks. Proper insulation and warning labels are mandatory.
· Mechanical: The cutting mechanism has sharp blades and pinch points. Protective guards and interlocks should be used.
· Fumes: Melting PET can release acetaldehyde. Operation in a well-ventilated area or with local exhaust ventilation is strongly recommended.
· Electrical: All components must be properly grounded and wired according to standards to prevent shock hazards.
